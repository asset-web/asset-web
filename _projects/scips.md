A research project in the site preservation maintenance period. Originally an EU funded project with a project site and 6 web resources in Bulgaria, France, Greece, Poland, Romania, and the UK. The UK resource is now maintained by the [University of Worcester](https://www.worcester.ac.uk).  Originally **7 multilingual sites** built in **Plone CMS** that were subsequently all migrated to **Drupal** between 2010-2016.  With separate post-project funding, the UK site was migrated to **WordPress** in 2016.  This research project launched an additional 7 ETTAD and 7 QATRAIN2 related research project sites, between 2008-2014.
